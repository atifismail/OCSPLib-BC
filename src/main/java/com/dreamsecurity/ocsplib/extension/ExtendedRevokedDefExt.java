/**
 * This extension indicates that the responder supports the extended definition
 * of the "revoked" status to also include non-issued certificates according to
 * Section 2.2. One of its main purposes is to allow audits to determine the
 * responderâ€™s type of operation. Clients do not have to parse this extension in
 * order to determine the status of certificates in responses.
 * 
 * This extension MUST be included in the OCSP response when that response
 * contains a "revoked" status for a non-issued certificate. This extension MAY
 * be present in other responses to signal that the responder implements the
 * extended revoked definition. When included, this extension MUST be placed in
 * responseExtensions, and it MUST NOT appear in singleExtensions.
 * 
 * This extension is identified by the object identifier
 * id-pkix-ocsp-extended-revoke.
 * 
 * id-pkix-ocsp-extended-revoke OBJECT IDENTIFIER ::= {id-pkix-ocsp 9}
 * 
 * The value of the extension SHALL be NULL. This extension MUST NOT be marked
 * critical.
